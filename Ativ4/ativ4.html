                <h2>        Description </h2>
                Electronic body music (commonly abbreviated as EBM, also known as industrial dance music) is a genre of electronic music that combines elements of industrial music with dance music. It developed in the early 1980s in Germany and Belgium and came to prominence at the end of the decade. The style has been characterized by relentless, programmed electronic beats, repetitive bass lines, and sequenced instrumentation.Typical EBM rhythms alternate between the 4/4 beats of disco and more abrasive rock-inspired backbeats.
                EBM was generally considered a part of the European new wave and post-punk movement and the first style that blended synthesized sounds with an ecstatic style of dancing. In the second half of the 1980s, a youth-cultural scene emerged from EBM whose followers describe themselves as EBM-heads or (in North America) as rivetheads.
